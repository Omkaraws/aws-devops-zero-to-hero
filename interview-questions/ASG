ASG: it is a cloud computing feature that allows you to automatically adjust the no. of computing resourses, such as virtual m/c or containers based on the current workload or demand.
The goal of ASG is to ensure that your applications run efficiently, maintain performance and minimize the cost by scaling up or down as needed.
creating grp of ec2 instances that can scale up or scale down depending on conditions you set. 
ASG helps you save cost by cutting down the no. of ec2 instances when not needed and scalling out to add more instances only when it is required.
